# How to use? Text guide: <br>
No coding knowledge required! :D
-Install PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ <br>
-Download the "Main" folder of this Git. <br>
-Open PyCharm, and load this project
-PyCharm will prompt you to configure the interpreter and install dependancies, this is normal and expected. Allow it to automatically do them.
-Run the program
-When Twitter opens the program will pause, log in to Twitter and then press ENTER inside the running terminal of PyCharm
-At this point PyCharm should direct itself to your bookmarks and download tweets whilst scrolling down, and this should be reflected in the running terminal.
-When it reaches the bottom of your bookmarks it will try scrolling a few times to ensure it is done, when it registers this, it will generate the PDF file.
